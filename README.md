This code calculates heatwave properties based on average daily apparent temperature. Accordingly, a heatwave (HW2) is defined as at least four consecutive days with apparent temperatures more than X percentile of historical Apparent temperature data. These properties/components are:

1-Number of Hot Days: A hot day is defined as a day with average apparent temperature above the threshold.
2-Severity of hot days: The cumulative average daily apparent temperatures above the threshold during hot days in each year
3-Number of Heatwaves
4-Total length of heatwaves
5-Longest heatwaves
6-Severity of heatwaves: The cumulative average daily apparent temperature above the threshold during heatwaves in each year
7-First day for heatwave 
8-Last day for heatwave
